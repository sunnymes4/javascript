/*
    DOM - Document Object Model

    A Data structure which resembles like a Tree/Graph
    And our Browser is Build on C++.
    So HTML, CSS comes from the server which Browser dosen't understand, so it converts into a format which C++(browser) can understand.
    So browser creates an Object representation of HTML, CSS to understand which is called OBJECT MODEL.
    Because OBJECT is a data structure C++ can understand.

    HTML Node = DOM API's.
    HTML converts to - DOM.
    CSS converts to - CSSOM.
    and DOM + CSSOM = Render Tree.

    -- Deffination --
    DOM is a Object represntation of HTML Document which resembels like a Tree.
    And this DOM object created by the Browser has alot of methods/functions inside of it,
    which are called as DOM API's and which empowers the HTML and give some interactive fetures to HTML Nodes inside the web page.
